\subsection{Detailed Description}
Collection of files comprising the Arbitros real-\/time operating system (R\-T\-O\-S). This module contains the collection of files--\hyperlink{arb__console_8c}{arb\-\_\-console.\-c}, arb\-\_\-device.\-c, arb\-\_\-error.\-c, arb\-\_\-idle.\-c, arb\-\_\-mailbox.\-c, \hyperlink{arb__main_8c}{arb\-\_\-main.\-c}, arb\-\_\-memory.\-c, arb\-\_\-printf.\-c, arb\-\_\-scheduler.\-c, arb\-\_\-semaphore.\-c, arb\-\_\-sys\-Timer.\-c, and arb\-\_\-thread.\-c--comprising the heart of the the Arbitros R\-T\-O\-S. The first file \hyperlink{arb__console_8c}{arb\-\_\-console.\-c}, provides the functionality for interfacing the kernel and user-\/space application with a terminal window via a user specified console driver. The second file arb\-\_\-device.\-c, defines a standard interface for linking a user-\/space application to an external device through the kernel. For those familiar with Linux, Arbitros incorporates standard function calls such as \#arb\-\_\-open, \#arb\-\_\-close, \#arb\-\_\-read, \#arb\-\_\-write, and \#arb\-\_\-ioctl in order to abstract--from the user--the intricate details that define how the driver communicates with an off-\/chip device. As seen in the figure, this framework allows a user-\/space application to interact with a particular entity--for instance a W\-I\-F\-I module--without having to know the specific details about how the device communicates (such as the particular U\-A\-R\-T and G\-P\-I\-O ports used). Furthermore, this driver \char`\"{}blue print\char`\"{} defines the way in which device driver software should be written in order to promote abstraction and commonality (at the user-\/space application layer) across a wide variety of potential device driver software developers. This construct will make it easier for anyone to develop new hardware and corresponding driver software applications (like the W\-I\-F\-I example in the figure) that immediately inter operate (i.\-e. no software changes required) with existing user-\/space software applications.  The third file arb\-\_\-error.\-c,
